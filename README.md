### Projects
- 🎵 [MiloMusic](https://github.com/futurespyhi/MiloMusic)  
A music generator built on Gradio integrating the use of four LLMs. First,"gpt-4o-transcribe" converts people's voice into text. Next, llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct generates lyrics based on the user's request or changes, and asks again if they want further edits. Then, Gemini generates the final lyrics based on the conversation history, using a structure that YuE can process. Finally, YuE makes splendid music based on the formatted lyrics.

- 🤖 [MiloGPT](https://github.com/futurespyhi/miloGPT)
A GPT-2 reproduction study from scratch, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's build-nanogpt. Implemented modern PyTorch optimizations including Flash Attention, fused AdamW, and proper weight initialization. Conducted learning rate ablation studies on 8×A100 GPUs, achieving 30%+ HellaSwag accuracy with cost-optimized training pipeline.
